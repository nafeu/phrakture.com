          I provide a two week (10 business day) trial period for any development
          team who wants to see what it is like working with me.

        <li style={{ marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>
          During this period, I set up a private collaboration board and we work
          together to develop concept material or even a full track for a
          specific need in your game (e.g. main menu music).
        </li>
        <li style={{ marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>
          I accept any and all feedback to help iterate the concept tracks I
          write and will also guide the devs on how to help find the sound they
          are looking for.

          I can sign and abide by any NDA&apos;s as needed for this process.

        <li style={{ marginBottom: '1.25rem' }}>
          After the trial period is over, I&apos;ll request that you provide a
          contract for me to sign under our agreed-upon pricing package and we
          can continue to work together (I can provide a template for you to
          create and maintain a contract if you haven&apos;t done so before).

          I have a firm stance AGAINST the use of AI-generated sound assets for
          soundtrack so you don&apos;t have to worry about any AI disclosure on
          Steam.
